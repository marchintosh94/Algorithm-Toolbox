The `minimumRefills` function is a solution to a common problem in algorithm design: the car fueling problem. This problem involves determining the minimum number of refills needed to travel from one city to another, given a car with a certain fuel capacity, a number of gas stations at specific distances, and the total distance to be traveled.

Here's a breakdown of the function:

- The function takes four parameters:

  - `d`: the total distance the car needs to travel.
  - `m`: the maximum distance the car can travel on a full tank of fuel.
  - `n`: the number of refill `stops` along the way.
  - `stops`: an array of the distances at which each stop is located.
- The function initializes three variables to 0: `numRefills` (the number of refills), `currentRefill` (the current stop), and `lastRefill` (the last stop where the car was refilled).

- It then creates a copy of the `stops` array and adds a stop at the beginning (at distance 0) and at the end (at distance d).

- The function then enters a loop that continues as long as `currentRefill` is less than or equal to `n`. Inside this loop, it enters another loop that continues as long as `currentRefill` is less than or equal to `n` and the distance to the next stop is less than or equal to `m`. If these conditions are met, `currentRefill` is incremented.

- If `currentRefill` is equal to `lastRefill` after the inner loop, this means the car couldn't reach the next stop with its current fuel, so the function returns -1.

- If `currentRefill` is still less than or equal to n after the inner loop, `numRefills` is incremented.

- Finally, the function returns `numRefills`, which is the minimum number of refills needed to travel the distance `d`.

This function uses a greedy algorithm approach, always trying to go as far as possible before refilling.
